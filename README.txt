For BST, there are 4 java code files

1) BSTGeneric.java
2) BSTGenericTest.java
- Will only show the final output and printout necessary lines. 


3) BSTGenericDebug.java
4) BSTGenericDebugtest.java
- More detailed version of 1 and 2, where the class is written to show 
  what happens in each line
- Since it involves recursion and will print a lot of lines, the Integer BST breakdown
  in the BSTGenericDebugTest is uncommented.
- The other parts are commented out to prevent confusion. If you would like to run the other
  classes, please uncomment based on the data type
